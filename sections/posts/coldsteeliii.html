                          <strong><u>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III [Game Review]</u></strong></p>

<main>
o<p><img src="/image/wiz.png" alt="wizhat" title="wizhat"> <em>TL;DR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/green.png" alt=""> This title is definitely a cinematic/story JRPG that stands on its own feet. If you are looking for a 100+ hour exciting, yet somewhat grindy, adventure (with replay value), then look no further and try this title out.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt=""> Game played in Nightmare difficulty setting with only one playthrough.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt=""> This title is 3 of 4 titles in the Cold Steel titles, and it is the first chapter of the second phase of the Cold Steel story. There is a movie/summary section in the game that can get you up to speed, if you prefer to skip the first two titles. (although I recommend playing the whole tetralogy)<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt=""> The Legend of Heroes titles (also referred as <i>Trails</i> or <i>Kiseki</i>) are all about world-building, so you can play the Cold Steel titles before the other major titles if you prefer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[<em>Played on a Nintendo Switch Lite</em>]</p>
<hr>
<p>Having played other Kiseki titles, it was absolutely paramount that I continue Rean Schwarzer’s adventures in the Cold Steel titles, and also be able to see the culmination of other regions’ stories come together as one. This title does not necessarily conclude anything or bring it all together, but it does set it up so that the next game (Cold Steel IV) can fulfill that.</p>
<p>Putting aside the massive world-building that Kiseki does, this title is an amazing JRPG experience that has lots of optional content that you want to do before the deadlines are over. There is a bit of life simulation tasks in this title, but they bring you into combat or into situations that are exciting. So while there is Persona-vibes with a calendar, there is no divide really between simulation and dungeon crawling. You will have a lot of cut-scenes, reading and talking to do in this title, however.</p>
<p>The game does have great turn-based battles and tactics. The systems are a bit reminiscent of materia from Final Fantasy VII, but it does add some new things to the conversation. Setting up your team to lack delay and be set up next in line for fighting is a very big part of building strategy in these games. (especially in the more difficult settings) There are a few ways to break the system in this game, which is a bit disappointing for someone who enjoys systems that require deep strategies and also changing it up. I can’t help but break the game if I know how to. Especially since it isn’t cheating, it is just utilizing the best strategy available.</p>
<p>I love that this title has optional boss fights that are super invigorating and exciting. Games that have exciting side content that isn’t overly demanding or boring make a really big impact. This is not an open-world game, but it really does allow you to feel free to explore. There is a lot of purpose in the narratives and story-telling, and you really feel like you are immersed in the world. There is obviously a grindy trend to this game, as it is a JRPG. It just comes with the territory. I can’t help but be inspired to keep the grind going with all my cute, cool and sexy costumes for the characters though. Beside if you get bored of the grind, you can also play a mini-game/card game “Vantage Masters” with friends/NPCs. I’m definitely an avid player of JRPGs, but the Kiseki games really suck you in and the story telling is very engrossing. If you enjoy this story, you will want to definitely play the other titles to figure out the other pieces of the puzzle in this story. The game comes equip with a whole section of movies that can get you up to speed with the Cold Steel story-line.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the most tactically-demanding title or anything super different in a JRPG, you won’t find that here. You will, however, find a great story and a world full of mystery that begs you to unravel it. As long as you find value in that, you will really be hooked on Kiseki for sure.</p>
