<main>
<p><img src="/image/wiz.png" alt="wizhat" title="wizhat"> <em>TL;DR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/green.png" alt="[✔]" title="[✔]"> This title carefully addresses the FIRST generation of Castlevania, from its 8 bit era to the start of the start of the 16 bit era. It also includes never-before-released in North America: the original Kid Dracula.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt="[*]" title="[*]"> All Titles: * Castlevania (NES, 1986) / * Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (NES, 1987) / * Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse (NES, 1989) / * Super Castlevania IV (SNES, 1991) / * Castlevania: The Adventure (Game Boy, 1989) / * Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge (Game Boy, 1991) / * Castlevania: Bloodlines (Sega Genesis, 1994) / * Kid Dracula (Famicom , 1990) **<i>please note I write American names for console such as NES/SNES if it has NA release, and list Japanese name such as Famicom to distinguish that this was not released in NA.</i><br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt="[*]" title="[*]"> This collection is not for those who are Symphony of the Night or the new era of Castlevania fans, as it only includes released from 1986 to 1994 (and then again, it isn't even a complete collection of all titles in that time period) ... </p>

<p>I love Castlevania, and while there are numerous ways to access old titles besides the Anniversary Collection: I did not have that option being in prison. This was a great way to replay older titles I love as well as get to play Kid Dracula for the first time! It is a bummer that there is not even one Castlevania collection that includes Symphony of the Night. (at least there is an Advanced collection!) I think that these collection titles are a nice way to immortalize the titles of Castlevania, as we live in a world where 70% of games must be pirated and modified to even be played due to DRM or lack of support for new systems. I hope that Konami continues to at least release collections of their older titles, rather than do what Nintendo (and even Sega decisively taking their titles off other platforms to promote theirs) does with their cloud gaming services. I do believe in the rights of ROM ownership as that is the best way we can immortalize old titles, however I guess a collection title is better than Konami raking in monthly cash from subscriptions. It is also a shame that Konami does sit on their IPs so much, but that is a topic for another article.</p>
<p>I hope that this review was helpful or at least a blast from the past or somewhat interesting history from my perspective. I try to make Castlevania a tradition I play at least in October or Halloween time. I didn't get to last time as I was just released and adjusting, and life gets life-y. However, my last Halloween in prison was spent playing Castlevania anniversary collection, and I'd have it no other way!</p>
<p>I will be individually reviewing each title from this collection starting now...</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania</u> (NES, 1986)</p>
<p>AKA 悪魔城ドラキュラ / Akumajou Dorakyura (JP) [lit. Devil's Castle Dracula].</p>
<p>This is the title that started it all for Castelavania. I really forget how advanced this was for its time, and how well it has aged. It almost makes me think, "Wow! I can't believe this is a game from the 1980s..." With lots of weapons/items to choose from, and unique/diverse boss mechanics, it really makes you amazed at the technical prowess of Konami developers. You play as Simon Belmont in this title and as a member of the Belmont clan and inheritor of the Vampire Hunter whip, it is your inherited duty to battle Count Dracula. The soundtrack is so iconic, with Intro, Bloody Tears, and Vampire Killer... so amazing that these titles are so amazing they get renditions in newer versions of Castlevania and even in the transition from the Heavy metal aesthetic to the more Gothic new era of Castlevania, you still have the integrity of a Castlevania game that doesn't try to be anything else for the sake of capitalism or superficial goals... This isn't my favorite of the NES era by far, but it definitely set the bar high for platformers.</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</u> (NES, 1987)</p>
<p>AKA ドラキュラⅡ 呪いの封印 / Dorakyura II: Noroi no Fuuin (JP) [lit. Dracula II: Seal of the Curse].</p>
<p>This is not strictly a platformer, but more of an RPG with platforming and Castlevania mechanics!!! Simon's Quest is a direct sequel to the first Castlevania game. Before his demise, Dracula has placed a curse upon Simon, giving him an early death unless Simon collects all of Dracula's body parts and revives him. In this title, you get to interact and do typical RPG communication puzzles alongside platforming challenges to then finally battle Dracula again after you have revived him. This title is definitely different than any other Castlevania game, which is not necessarily bad, but if you are looking for the classic Castlevania style: this is not exactly it. I urge RPG fans to give this title a try for sure.</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</u> (NES, 1989)</p>
<p>AKA 悪魔城伝説 / Akumajou Densetsu (JP) [lit. Legend of the Evil Demon Castle] -- same title as first title.</p>
<p>Among my favorites of the Castlevania games and my favorite in the NES era is this title. You play as Trevor C. Belmont, an early/ancient Belmont clan member from the 15th century! (The first two in the core series were in the late 17th century) This title is awesome because you have other playable characters you can get depending on which locations you go to. These characters are: Sypha Belnades, Grant Danasy, and Alucard. I really enjoy the later boss battles in this game, especially the boss battle where you battle a shadow of yourself (which also transforms to the other characters when you transform...), and these later boss battles really challenge you so much in different ways. The back-to-back challenges and the non-linear nature of this game are what set it apart from a lot of titles of its time. I love all the different abilities of the other characters and the unique re-playability that this title offers.</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Super Castlevania IV</u> (SNES, 1991)</p>
<p>AKA 悪魔城ドラキュラ / Akumajō Dracula (JP) [lit. Devil's Castle Dracula].</p>
<p>This is basically a remake title, before remakes were cool! You play again as Simon, and with a new 16 bit graphics and sounds as well as new mechanics like using the Vampire Hunter whip to swing. The mechanics are very smoothed out in this title, and they brought a lot of new life to the levels from Castlevania I. There is definitely a bit more of a "heavy metal" vibe to these graphics than ever, and it really shows well in the 16 bit era. There isn't much to say about this title besides that Konami mostly probably used this opportunity to transition to the 16 bit era more than anything. Going back and remaking a great title from before and making it even better in some ways. There still is a certain novelty of the first Castlevania title as well as with its own difficulties due to the hardware and development limitations it may have had that make it so unique, so I definitely prefer the first Castlevania to this one.</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania: The Adventure</u> (Game Boy, 1989)</p>
<p>AKA ドラキュラ伝説 / Dracula Densetsu (JP) [lit. The Legend of Dracula].</p>
<p>This title is black/white as it is game boy classic. There are a lot of limitations with these game boy platformers, and there aren't even sub-weapons you can get in this title. It is almost like Castlevania on training-wheels to be honest. Even so, it is worth the challenge for anyone willing to take it. Early Game Boy is even impressive in its own ways, but it is also kind of a downgrade and the other Castlevania titles definitely ruin my interest in exploring the Castlevania Adventure titles. Castlevania didn't get a great title until the Game Boy Advanced era anyway...</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge</u> (Game Boy, 1991)</p>
<p>AKA ドラキュラ伝説 II / Dracula Densetsu II (JP) [lit. "The Legend of Dracula II].</p>
<p>Christopher is at it again, and this time he seeks revenge against Dracula for turning his son Soleil into a demon. Dracula turns into a thin mist at the end of the previous title, and was able to assume human form again through Soleil's sacred powers. In this title, they at least incorporated sub-weapons, however only the axe (or cross in JP or EU versions) and holy water (better than nothing I suppose). This title isn't much of a step forward from the first, but it is Konami's best attempt at a contending platformer title in the handheld market.</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Castlevania: Bloodlines</u> (Sega Genesis, 1994)</p>
<p>AKA バンパイアキラー Banpaia Kira (JP) [lit. VAMPIRE KILLER].</p>
<p>This is a great 16 bit title. You can play either as John Morris (a descendant of the Belmont clan) from Texas, USA or Eric Lecarde (a friend of John Morris) from Segovia, Spain... You are primarily trying to prevent the niece of Dracula Elizabeth Bartley, brought back by Witch/Sorceress Drolta Tzuentes, from bringing her Uncle back. And as we all know where this leads, an ultimate fight against Count Dracula at the end as usual. The mechanics of this game are very smooth/clean. I especially like the new weapon, using the Spear from Eric Lecarde is awesome. While this title doesn't have as many playable characters as Castlevania III, having the option of two at the start menu is a nice addition. This is the last title in the old generation of Castlevania (but is argued also as the start of the new generation due to its European title being labeled the new gen) as well as the first title with Michiru Yamane as composer. She would go on to work with on Castlevania titles for around another two decades. Definitely an inspiration to me working with PSGs or chiptune sounds!!! (and as a pianist)</p>
<hr>
<p>* <u>Kid Dracula</u> (Famicom, 1990)</p>
<p>AKA 悪魔城すぺしゃる ぼくドラキュラくん / Akumajou Special: Boku Dracula-kun (JP) [lit. Demon Castle Special: I'm Kid Dracula].</p>
<p>This is my first time playing the title. I'm reminded of Megaman mixed with Castlevania. This title is funny and bright compared to what I'm used to in a Castlevania game... There is a lot of color to this title, and a lot more playfulness. Don't let that fool you though, this is still classic metroidvania and you have to bring your A-game to beat this title. The bosses are funny in this game, yet still have the challenge of figuring out their movements and weaknesses. I really recommend Kid Dracula to anyone who wants to play a lite version of Castlevania with some new additions to it as well.</p>
