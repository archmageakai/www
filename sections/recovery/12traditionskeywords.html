<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>UNITY</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
depends on NA unity.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>LEADERSHIP</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[For our group purpose there is but one ultimate
authority—a loving God as He may express Himself
in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted
servants; they do not govern.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>ELIGIBILITY</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
using.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>AUTONOMY</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Each group should be autonomous except in matters
affecting other groups or NA as a whole.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>CARRYING THE MESSAGE</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry the
message to the addict who still suffers.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>OUTSIDE ENTERPRISES</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the
NA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our
primary purpose.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>SELF-SUPPORTING</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting,
declining outside contributions.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>GIVING IT AWAY (FREE OF CHARGE)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever
nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ
special workers.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>ORGANIZATION</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
service boards or committees directly responsible to those
they serve.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="10">
<li>OUTSIDE OPINIONS (NO POLITICS/CONTROVERSY)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues;
hence the NA name ought never be drawn into
public controversy.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>PUBLIC RELATIONS</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather
than promotion; we need always maintain personal
anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.]</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="12">
<li>ANONYMITY</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>[Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our
Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before
personalities.]</p>
