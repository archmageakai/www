<h3 id="12-traditions-of-narcotics-anonymous"><em>12 Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
depends on NA unity.</li>
<li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate
authority—a loving God as He may express Himself
in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted
servants; they do not govern.</li>
<li>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
using.</li>
<li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters
affecting other groups or NA as a whole.</li>
<li>Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry the
message to the addict who still suffers.</li>
<li>An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the
NA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our
primary purpose.</li>
<li>Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting,
declining outside contributions.</li>
<li>Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever
nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ
special workers.</li>
<li>NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
service boards or committees directly responsible to those
they serve.</li>
<li>Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues;
hence the NA name ought never be drawn into
public controversy.</li>
<li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather
than promotion; we need always maintain personal
anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.</li>
<li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our
Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before
personalities.</li>
</ol>
