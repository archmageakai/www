<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/orange.png" alt="[!]" title="[!]"> This game is just Mega Man for noobs basically, and doesn't add anything to stand up to new platformers and also can't beat older Mega Man games in the core series.<br>
<img src="/image/orange.png" alt="[!]" title="[!]"> "Slap and paste a skin over older Mega Man titles..." Capcom has given up on Mega Man basically... sad.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt="[*]" title="[*]"> This game has lots of achievements and fun to enjoy, collect-them-all type trophies for those that are completionists and want to 100% it all. For those that like a platforming challenge, maybe you can have fun with that. For me, I'd rather just go back to Mega Man 2. </p>

<p>I really like the Mega Man X games the most, as all these titles have awesome customizations for platforming, fast-paced action, more story, as well as its more "mature" nature. However, I do got a special place in my heart for the core games, especially Mega Man 2. I was excited to play Mega Man 11, but was truly disappointed. There are hardly any cutscenes or story to make this game feel modern. I don't mind the 2d platforming style that this game retains, and in some ways its polished and looks pretty. I don't like how 2d platforming has been mostly replaced by 3d platforming, especially in the big platformer titles (mario & sonic). While I think 3d platforming has a time and place, I love the 2d platforming (metroidvania especially). Disappointing for this game is that it just feels like earlier Mega Man titles with a new skin.</p>
<p>While I did enjoy the energy of the boss battles as well as the new soundtrack and graphics overall, I know the fans deserve a lot better. Why can't there be decent story cutscenes to follow rather than a generic Mega Man story? I love the upgrades and changing the suit as well as all the other things that make it a Mega Man game, but I can't help but feel like Capcom created Mega Man 11 as a quick cashgrab. The fans deserve so much better. This is a trend in a lot of newer Capcom titles (incl. MvC), where capitalism and cheap/quick programming beats taking a chance with a game.</p>
<p>Aside from Mega Man 11 being just Mega Man with polished graphics and sound, there is a decent amount of achievement trophies and other platforming challenges that can be fun, if you like to play platformers to 100%. At least there is a decent amount of replayability for the fan of the Mega Man platforming style. This game doesn't make it super easy the way the new Mario or Sonic games do. It still has decent amount of learning curve, yet can be a bit more forgiving than earlier titles (Mega Man II). While I don't completely like all of that, I get it... and at least I can be happy that the series of Mega Man hasn't fallen completely to the pressures (making the game playable/easy for kids) that Mario or other popular platformers have fallen to.</p>
<p>Capcom has disappointed a lot of fans with the lack of content or new in their newer titles. Typical graphical boosts and just slapping a skin over a title is the go-to, and also a slight change to mechanics takes away from the integrity of their games as well. While it does make for a more forgiving title (where if I jump from point A.1 or A.2 and get to point B.1), I still like the challenge of Mega Man 2 where I really have to be careful where I execute my jumps and manuevers. Mega Man core games have always been more "technical" platformer which is fitting for the tech/robotic-style of the game, whereas Mega Man X has been more action/fast-paced and gear-customization oriented... Capcom should not break the formula that works, where core games and X are like a yin-yang, yet they need to put more energy into the Mega Man core series as it is getting to a point where it is so repetitive that it isn't even worth the play. Even the later Mega Man X titles have lost their novelty and need to be re-evaluated. Overall, stay away from newer Capcom titles. For the core Mega Man games: I recommend Mega Man 2 and for the Mega Man X games: I recommend Mega Man X4. These are great stand-alone titles that evoke the true integrity of the Mega Man franchise!</p>
