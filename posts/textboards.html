                          <strong><u>Textboards that I use</u></strong></p>

<main>
<p>
This is not a comprehensive list of "active" textboards or anything like that. I just wanted to record the (Nipponese) textboards that I actually use (lurk), record my status or use of them, as well as record their features as of now. I don't usually use imageboards anymore, and it has been over 10 years that I've been a regular 4chan user/poster/lurker. I don't like mainstream boards/trees very much. I also have more of a preference toward tree-style, tag-related boards rather than textboards that are divided by /board/. That being said, there are some textboards that are listed here that use the /board/ format. List is not written in any particular order, or is it?

<b>Pohon BBS - <a href="https://bbs.gikopoi.com">https://bbs.gikopoi.com</a></b> <br />
(atom feeds available for all threads, recent commends, and all tags)
</p>

<p>
Within the realms of Gikopoi, there is a BBS. This site takes after ayashii.net design (which is really appealing and a nice balance between dark/light modes), but simplifies all the clunkiness and actually performs very well. There are odd features like enable LL (long lines) or No Bump (sage). Enabling LL (or not) feature empowers the user to either let the software wrap text for them or for the user to decide where they decide to wrap their text. No Bump is just sage, so essentially a rebranding of an old function of any Nipponese board. The important highlight of Pohon is that it allows users to either read in thread-mode or tree-mode. (I prefer tree-mode the most) This board is tag-based rather than divided by board. That way you can filter or not filter all posts however you would prefer (with the provided tagging). Overall, Pohon keeps it simple yet empowers the user by taking all the best components of a BBS in general. (also: src code here <a href="https://github.com/153/pohon2">https://github.com/153/pohon2</a>)

<b>6ch - <a href="https://sageru.org">https://sageru.org</a></b> <br />
(RSS feed available)
</p>

<p>
While I don't often look at this board, I do love those bees! I am more interesting in Sageru's IRC obviously, but I do have the Feed for this board and will lurk when bored. I enjoy the array of themes I can use on the site, but I opt for the default MWN theme as it is a lot easier on the eyes. When I spend too much time lurking, I realize I've seen most of the posts and it just makes me want to get back to Sageru IRC. This board is not tag-based or divided in different /boards/. This board uses the kareha software, so expect features to be more consistent with typical Nipponese-style boards.
</p>

<p>
<u>My use</u>: Lurking occasionally, posting seldom

<b>Tinychan BBS - <a href="https://dis.tinychan.net">https://dis.tinychan.net</a></b> <br />
(RSS feeds available for each board)
</p>

<p>
The most unknown part of Tinychan is its unlisted textboard. A /boards/-based textboard. It has 4 boards: /anarchy/ /lounge/ /prog/ (screenshot listed) and /test/. There are a decent amount of styles/themes available too. I use Terminal theme because it is the only one generally easier on my eyes. This board uses its own software, which I don't know if it is actually sourced or not. I am going to assume that it isn't because the FAQ doesn't list a link to it and states it uses its own software.
</p>

<p>
<u>My use</u>: (seldom) Lurking /prog/
</p>

<b>Channel4 BBS - <a href="https://4-ch.net/4ch.html">https://4-ch.net/4ch.html</a></b> <br />
(RSS feeds available for each board)
</p>

<p>
This textboard also is separated by /boards/. This is another board that uses the kareha software. There is a decent amount of themes as well. I use Tanasinn's theme as it has consistent vibes with the Akai style, as well as easy on the eyes. I don't have a lot of history with this board, so I'll keep my analysis brief with this one. I do like some of the unique Anon names depending on the board you are on, as well as the forced Anon on /iaa/. There is also an image board available too. Uses the kareha software.
</p>

<p>
<u>My use</u>: I mostly lurk on /iaa/ as it is always fun to find obscure and/or helpful Internet links.

<b>world2ch BBS - <a href="https://world2ch.net/world2ch.html">https://world2ch.net/world2ch.html</a></b> <br />
(NO FEEDS AVAILABLE)
</p>

<p>
Considered by many to be a hollow shell of the original world2ch, and I won't go into this discourse. Instead, I'll just list this as a viable option for textboarding. This is another one separated by /boards/. It also advocates Gikopoi. Uses the kareha software.
</p>

<p>
<u>My use</u>: ASCII Art fun on /lounge/ and using /aatester/

This textboard has a lot of potential, but the admin can't get over their self. Most boards use futaba or buun theme or some derivative of that, and they are basically 2ch ver 5000.0 or something. This site is not trying to be that at all. I like that this is just a stream of consciousness. There are no threads or boards or trees yet it has the DNA of a textboard. This site reminds me of <a href="https://postzone.app">https://postzone.app</a>, and it can be a lot better too. Tripcodes and secure tripcodes use SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively (rather than DES and SHA-1 which are the standards for Nipponese-styled boards)&#x2026;. I really don't like that inconsistency. There are also open hours between 08:00 to 22:00 UTC. ("Quirky") &#x2026; No source code available, so another thumbs down there.

If you have any recommendations for other textboards, I'll definitely check them out. Maybe I'll even do a future post about them. I don't think that textboards are truly dead. As long as there are some of us that appreciate their slow nature and can find some purpose in them, the format is very much alive and well. I do think that I should probably contribute more, and lurk a lot less. Sometimes it is hard for me to see the value in my posts, and when I do get around to textboarding I generally am just looking for an idle activity. There are a lot of textboards I do miss, but hopefully the spirit of them stays alive as we go on.
