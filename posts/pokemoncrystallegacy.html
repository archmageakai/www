<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/green.png" alt="[✔]" title="[✔]"> This is the best way to re-explore Pokemon Crystal, as this romhack does not veer away from the integrity of what made this game amazing.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt="[*]" title="[*]"> This romhack strives to make a more balanced and refined experience of Pokemon Crystal, giving the single-player more power and ability to enjoy the entirety of this title. All 251 pokemon are accessible within the game, as well as Kanto is revamped and upscaled (levels).<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt="[*]" title="[*]"> This romhack adds more QoL features such as running shoes, 251 pokemon sprites in overworld/menu, HM deletion, early EXP share, bigger backpack, and more.<br>

<p><em>I streamed this game on <a href="https://play.gikopoi.com">Gikopoi</a> in its entirety (completed all the story and pokedex!)</em></p>

<p>This was the first game/romhack that I streamed to completion! I had a great experience doing so, and Pokemon Crystal Legacy was still a social experience that Pokemon always was even though it was only me playing the game. I really love that this game sticks very close to the vanilla game. There are lots of modifications to this title to allow for all 251 pokemon to be caught, as well as a slight modification in Silver's storyline (which added more flavor without taking away from the canon). There is information all over the web about this title, so look around and you'll be sure to find a good amount of information.</p>
<p>I recommend taking your time with this romhack, and just enjoy it. There is a lot that is still the same as Crystal. It is very intuitive and you can figure out lots of the modifications out on your own. Explore, talk to NPCs, and you will be sure to complete that pokedex if you are patient and willing. Pokemon Crystal has aged so well, and the added graphics such as 251 overworld sprites for each mon was a great addition that added to the experience. I love how there is a sequence break at the point of Ecruteak City, and I can tackle badges 5-7 in whatever order I prefer.</p>

<small>This is the team I used in the epic battle with Red.</small></center></p>
<p>There were some minor issues I have with this romhack, and that is how the levels are not scaled in certain areas. You don't get access to Whirl Islands until around badge 7 and even then you cannot get the Silver Wing until you get to Kanto. The wild pokemon in Whirl Islands are all around lvl 23-25, presenting not much of a challenge on the way to lvl 60 Lugia. Other than that, I had no issues with this game. They upscaled Kanto a lot, and they made it interesting to battle a few historical trainers with Legendaries on their team.</p>
<p>I changed my team up a lot in this romhack. I even caught a Shiny Zubat (named it "Gween") early on in the game, that I used throughout the playthrough and made a champion (as a Crobat). You can rematch with all the Johto gym leaders, and I really recommend this as a way to grind and make money FAST. As I said before, Kanto is upscaled and that includes the Legacy/historic trainers like Blue or Red. TheSmithPlays did a fantastic job at making this game balanced yet also challenging, while also making me believe I was re-experienced Pokemon Crystal in a 100% playthrough as if I was a kid again.</p>

<small>I caught him as a Zubat within 10 minutes or so of playing!</small></center></p>
<p>Not related to this romhack, but also giving credit to Crystal Legacy for allowing me to enjoy the game to its entirety: I really love Gen II of Pokemon so much. The design is so iconic, and just feels much more complete than the original 151 in Gen I. This is the only Gen that you can traverse two regions, and this game will definitely feel more complete than any of the newer generations (even if I do enjoy the monsters in those games a lot!)... The soundtrack was so immersive, and how they have town music for two regions as well as awesome Kanto battle music is what makes this game so dynamic for its time. The spritework on the base game and then the romhack sprites/animations for each mon (as said before) just blends right in with the style. Amazing.</p>

<small>Diploma of completion of Pokedex... Make sure to go find Mew after you get this!</small></center></p>
<p>This is <b>*not*</b> my last romhack by any means! And it is also <b>*not*</b> my last Pokemon Crystal romhack either! My next hurrah will be Pokemon Crystal Clear, which is vastly different in design objectives from this romhack. I'm excited to get to it, but I also can't wait to replay Pokemon Crystal Legacy in its entirety all over again someday as well.</p>
