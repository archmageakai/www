<p><img src="/image/wiz.png" alt="wizhat" title="wizhat"> <em>TL;DR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/green.png" alt=""> the worlds of Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem cross-over to make this amazing JRPG, which is an amazing gift for fans of both these series as well as for #jp, /jp/, JRPG fans and Japanese entertainment fans.<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" alt=""> The gameplay and combat of this title mostly reflects SMT, utilizing mechanics and systems from both SMT and Fire Emblem. This is a turn-based game with emphasis on combos. This is not a tactical grid RPG. That being said, this game has a perfect balance of SMT and FE.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>Before I actually dive into this review, I’d like to clarify my background with both these series. I don’t think it is important you play any of these games before this title, as it does stand on its own, however as a fan of both Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem for well over 20 years, I couldn’t help but be excited to finally play this title. For fans and non-fans, there is some cosmetics from SMT/Persona, but the real star characters from this cross-over are the Demon/Persona (called Mirages in this title) versions of Fire Emblem 1 and Fire Emblem Awakening characters. If you are a fan of Archanea/Ylisse Fire Emblem, then you’ll be really happy to enjoy these characters in their SMT-esque forms. Other than that, expect more SMT-style battle mechanics as well as dungeon-crawling. The skills and magic are a fusion of SMT and FE, and I especially like the rock-paper-scissors (sword-lance-axe) of FE being inherited.</p>
<p>Aside from the SMT and FE cross-over aspects of this title, this title is centered around the Japanese pop/entertainment industry, and anyone that is #jp, /jp/ OG status will definitely like the references and energy of this title. While you do get to explore a good amount in Tokyo, this is not as extensive as I would have liked it to be. Fans of Persona 5 or any other game with Tokyo exploration will be underwhelmed with this title in that aspect. The real enthusiasm and life is from the J-pop tracks and music videos throughout the game. There are side-stories and side-quests that I recommend you dive into before you clear the game. There are two ending to this game, and the true ending isn’t much different but you can accomplish this easily by just making sure to do all the side-stories. In that sense, I don’t really like that lack of mystery and it is less demanding of a replay. I really enjoyed the characters a lot, and wish there was support links like in Persona or even marriage at the end of the title or something to keep the ending interesting and unique for each playthrough.</p>
<p>Despite the shortcomings of this title, which are small and few, I will say that I look forward to playing again in Lunatic mode and that will make for a fun New Game+ play of a title that I really enjoyed. (as well as enjoyed listening to repetitively to the tracks on the events theater) My only true complaint is that I wish there was more in this title. The Tokyo Mirage concept has potential and draws from iconic series and themes, and it is a shame to see that this title will most likely be buried underneath all the titles that come after it. Most cross-overs are just a cash grab, but this game stands on its own feet, gives anyone playing a good time and gives the fans what they deserve. I hope that Atlus and/or Intelligent Systems get together again to collaborate and give both these series another chance to cross-over.</p>
