                          <strong><u>Pokemon Lets Go Eevee [Game Review]</u></strong></p>

<p><img src="/image/wiz.png"> <em>TL;DR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/pink.png" title="[*]"> This is a great place to start if you are new to Pokemon (or play Lets Go Pikachu if you prefer Pikachu more).<br>
<img src="/image/pink.png" title="[*]"> This is basically like playing Yellow version except with Eevee, and new graphics and conveniences.<br>
<img src="/image/orange.png" title="[!]"> I’m not sure if I’d recommend the purchase of this title unless you really like Eevee or really just want to collect any Pokemon title that exists. Don’t fall for the nostalgia buy. The best Gen I nostalgia is the real thing, or play Gen II or Gen I remakes.<br>
<img src="/image/orange.png" title="[!]"> I don’t recommend this game if you are looking for a more serious title or RPG. Even for a Pokemon game, there is even more emphasis on the cuteness and excessive collection of cute mons, so this is not a title for serious RPG lovers.<br>
<img src="/image/red.png" title="[x]"> All wild encounters in this game use a similar mechanic to Pokemon GO the mobile game, and that is a huge deal breaker for some people.<br>

<p>It feels good to be back in the Kanto region, but with a new twist, I get to have Eevee as my starter, and we both get to have all sorts of cute outfits as well as Eevee getting some custom moves that are exclusive only to this game. Eevee is a very powerful mon in this game as you can use items to increase his stats and they can learn lots of cool moves corresponding to all the different Eeveelutions. (sorry, but you can’t evolve the Eevee starter in this game, and why would you? For once, you get to let your Eevee be an Eevee and actually stand a chance in battle!!)</p>
<p>This game incorporates mega-evolutions and Alola region versions of older mons, which is consistent with most remakes that they would include the new with the old. However, Gen I remakes Fire Red/Leaf Green included breeding and other features that were not included in the Lets Go titles. There is also a limited number of mons in this game, which is now the new trend in Pokemon games, which is rather annoying if you got mons you’d love to bring over and use. This title is just Yellow version with a lot of polish (without substance) and the simple annoyances/limitations of a mobile game. If you don’t like Pokemon GO, then definitely don’t play this game because wild encounters are similar to the mechanics of that game.</p>
<p><i>I’ll be honest with you...</i> I do like this game and did have some fun. I like the playful nature of it, and if you want more out of the game you can get a lot of play out of this game if you are into the shiny grind or whatever. <i>That being said...</i> there just are a lot better titles for Pokemon that deserve more attention than this, even some of the newer ones. I am happy that Eevee has a title now that it deserves, but I only bought this title because I wanted to get every Pokemon title I could get at the time. Playing it with friends and enjoying seeing Pokemon in the over-world was really cool, nicknaming Pokemon funny names, etc (the closest we get to a Lets Play or steaming live in prison). I can appreciate that Game Freak gave us the opportunity to go back to Kanto again, but for my next time in Kanto I’d rather play Gen I, Gen II, or the Gen I remakes.</p>
