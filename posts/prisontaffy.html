<u>Ingredients</u>* :<br>
~230 mL - powdered coffee creamer (classic/null flavor)<br>
~30 mL - water<br>
~3 ct. - single mix packets of skittles green apple juice**<br><br>

* <i>these ingredients will vary depending on which products you use, as well as if you prefer stronger or lighter flavor</i><br>
---> <i>lighter flavor add more creamer / stronger flavor add more juice</i> <---<br>
** <i>you can use any juice that you would prefer. I prefer to use singles packs as I find some of the best flavors compared to larger drink mixes in a tub.</i><br><br>
</p>

<p>
(( Note: This recipe could potentially work without the use of water and instead of powder drink mix, you could use a liquid drink mix... however to stay with the integrity of how we made this in prison, I wanted to demonstrate it with juice packets and water. We used varieties of juice singles, incl. state-issued ones from the kitchen, crystal light juice, sunkist, orange crush, skittles, jolly rancher, starburst, hawaiian punch, kool aid ... ))
</p>

<p>
<u>Directions</u> :<br>
[1] Put a decent amount (about half) of your powdered coffee creamer, your juice mix of choice (varies on amount, figure out what you prefer: more or less flavor) in a bowl or mixing vessel of your choice ... <br>
[2] add 30 mL of water (yes not that much water, and even then maybe add it in increments to be safe) in a bowl <br>
[3] Start mixin' and add more creamer as you go ... <br>
[4] you will notice at first you probably have a more gritty consistency of taffy ... <br>
[5] don't give up, you will get passed this gritty phase, so keep adding creamer and mix!! <br>
[6] Once your taffy has become less gritty (and therefore not really sticky at all) .. you can play with it with your hands and knead it ... make sure to knead it into all the extra creamer in your bowl .. <br>
[7] you should have a nice neat ball of taffy now from kneading and rolling in your hands <br>
[8] you can even roll on a surface to add more creamer easily if you want <br>
[9] you may notice that this will make the taffy a lot more consistent overall <br>
[10] you should have mixed all your creamer into this ball of taffy, and now your taffy is ready to be ate if you want at this point, although i like to let it sit and get a bit harder<br>
[11] Here, I rolled the taffy again<br>
[12] I use a kitchen knife to cut the taffy into pieces to be ate <br><br>

test out your taffy, give yourself a treat. <br>
Not enough flavor? you can add more juice! <br>
[ or ] <br>
Too much flavor? add more creamer! <br>
knead and roll!
</p>

<p>
Please note that this taffy won't be turning into cement any time soon, but do be sure to eat within 3-4 days.. Haven't tried refrigerating this stuff or any of that or even tested on long-term fresh, etc. I am not responsible if you get sick, just so you know! I prefer to wait about a day before eating most of it, I do like to sample a bit because it is so delicious. After about a day, I think it is just about perfect for me.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot more we can do to customize our taffy and get even more creative, but the purpose of this post is to get you an idea of how to get started in your taffy making journey. Please be sure to keep an eye out for more recipes on the gikoverse wiki [ see <a href="https://wiki.gikopoi.com/r/CategoryFood">here</a> ] as well as looking at prison food wiki article [ see <a href="https://wiki.gikopoi.com/w/PrisonFood">here</a> ] ... or you can follow atom/rss :3
