♡ <br><strong><u>Sageru #jp takeover: #jp vs FSE & tokiko boyz</u></strong><br>

<p>"<i>FSE is PART of #jp CULTURE<br>
TOKIKO IS #jp<br>
I AM #jp</i>"<br>
-Akai</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://sageru.org/irc/">sageru irc</a> #jp was reclaimed by original creator Tokiko. I was given mod privileges. I did miss out on the birth of #jp , however I was very much part of the culture that embodied and inspired its creation. I was really happy to be part of another IRC channel that Tokiko made because I was part of the proto-#jp days. Unfortunately, #jp has devolved into non-Japanese culture topics, "transgooning", and other irrelevant content to what really is #jp culture. While #jp has always been friendly to all walks of life, while also maintaining a great sense of humor, there has been a regression in #jp topics and IRC in general. This is where things get interesting.</p>
<p>I decided to USE (by actually banning people that break the <a href="https://sageru.org/irc/rules.html">rules</a>) as well as ABUSE my mod privileges. I started awhile ago on fediverse begging for someone to buy me Dead Cells Medley of Pain bundle (includes all DLC) on my old fediverse account, but garnered little to no attention. When I came back to IRC and checked out sageru #jp, I then decided that this is the perfect place to ask. I got banned from #jp and thus this triggered a #jp takeover where Tokiko was given back what was rightfully his. Shortly after is where I was given mod privileges. I decided to take it upon myself to spam through the <a href="https://fsebugoutzone.org/jp">#jp tweet bot</a> that I want Dead cells and all the DLCs, and if these conditions were met that I would leave #jp. The #jp tweet bot is a part of the origins of #jp culture, and it was great to see it come back with my return to IRC. I also would ban people if they refused and banned people that were talking bad about Akai or Tokiko, etc. I decided that a purge was necessary to keep #jp in check. No-life haters reacted by flooding Sageru and joining with a couple thousand users to lag Sageru irc network. After the floods, I would continue with my demands for Dead Cells.</p>
<p>I managed to make lots of fans, and even people who dislike me might even find my work hilarious! You're welcome! Anyway, the best thing did happen today. A fan on fediverse <a href="https://fsebugoutzone.org/dsm">@dsm</a> surprised me with a GOG redeem link for Dead Cells with all the DLCs! His condition was that #jp tweet bot must come back (as it has had a staggered presence amidst shutdowns from flooding). I am happy to say that I have it now installed on my Steam Deck through Heroic games launcher! (super awesome program by the way.) Even better is that, I don't have to break a promise. (I wasn't going to leave #jp if someone bought me this game... w) Check this toot out: <a href="https://fsebugoutzone.org/notice/Au3vABBJldYRxmRLfs">https://fsebugoutzone.org/notice/Au3vABBJldYRxmRLfs</a> if you want to see all the screen shots involved!</p>
<p>I think I've earned my Sageru bee tattoo with a Dead Cells twist to it, as Sageru #jp's most greatest CIA janitor "Akai the Cleaner" !!! Thanks again @dsm for buying me the game, as I've wanted to enjoy Dead Cells with all the DLCs. I only played the basegame with maybe one of the DLCs (switch version)... so be sure to perhaps stay tune for a review of that as well as perhaps some articles about my next hoorah with this awesome game!</p>
